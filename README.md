## How to run this? 🚀

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agslima/Sistema-IoT-de-Controle.git
cd Sistema-IoT-de-Controle
```

**Add a new user:**

```bash
python3 add_user.py
```

**Follow the on-screen prompts to set a username and secure password**

```bash
Run the main system:
python3 main_system.py
```

## 📋 Project Overview

The primary goal of this system is to manage user authentication and access control in a physical environment. It simulates a secure gatekeeper system where:

* Users are identified via credentials.
* Passwords are stored securely using **MD5 hashing**.
* User data is persisted locally in a **CSV database**.
* Hardware interaction is handled via the **MRAA library**.

> **Note:** This project focuses on the *implementation of logic and hardware integration*. While MD5 is used here for educational demonstration of hashing concepts, modern production environments should utilize stronger algorithms (e.g., SHA-256 or bcrypt).

## 📂 Project Structure

The codebase is modularized to separate core logic, user management, and security validation.

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `main_system.py` | **Entry Point:** The main execution loop that handles the system state and hardware signals. |
| `function.py` | **Core Logic:** Contains reusable functions for authentication and data processing. |
| `add_user.py` | **Admin Tool:** Script to register new users or remove existing ones from the database. |
| `bad_password.py` | **Security:** Implements a blacklist validation to prevent users from choosing weak passwords. |

---

## 💾 Data Storage

User credentials are stored in a local `.csv` file to ensure persistence without requiring a heavy SQL database engine.

**Format Structure:**
```csv
username,password_hash
john_doe,e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03
alice,5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
```
